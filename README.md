TinDog - The Tinder for dogs
____________________________________________________________________
This little project was made as part of the Udemy Web Development Bootcamp by the LondonAppBrewery with instructor Angela Yu.
In this project we created a "Tinder" for dogs product page using Bootstrap.

I learned a lot during this project and I am excited to learn more about all the awesome features which Bootstrap has to offer. The journey of becoming a (better) developer sure is a long one but it is really fun and I am more motivated than ever to get better at this.
